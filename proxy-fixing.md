# MCP Proxy Debugging Investigation

## Issue Summary

When implementing the MCP proxy server, we encountered an error when trying to list tools through the proxy:

```
"Internal error: object list can't be used in 'await' expression"
```

This error occurs when the proxy server tries to handle MCP protocol requests (specifically `tools/list` and `tools/call`).

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Initial Implementation Approach

Our initial approach was to:
1. Create a `FastMCPProxy` instance using `FastMCP.as_proxy()`
2. Handle HTTP requests and forward them to the proxy
3. Access proxy methods directly (e.g., `proxy.list_tools()`)

```python
# Initial (incorrect) approach
proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(service, name="service_proxy")
tools = await proxy.list_tools()  # This doesn't exist!
```

### 2. Discovery: FastMCPProxy Doesn't Have Direct Methods

Through investigation, we found that `FastMCPProxy` doesn't expose `list_tools()` or `call_tool()` methods directly. Instead, it uses internal managers:

- `proxy._tool_manager` - ProxyToolManager
- `proxy._resource_manager` - ProxyResourceManager  
- `proxy._prompt_manager` - ProxyPromptManager

### 3. Second Attempt: Using Internal Managers

We tried accessing the internal tool manager:

```python
tools = await proxy._tool_manager.list_tools()
```

This led to the "object list can't be used in 'await' expression" error.

### 4. Root Cause Analysis

After examining the FastMCP source code and examples, we discovered the fundamental issue:

**The proxy is designed to be used with a Client, not accessed directly.**

The correct pattern from `examples/in_memory_proxy_example.py`:

```python
# Create proxy
proxy_server = FastMCP.as_proxy(original_server, name="InMemoryProxy")

# Use a CLIENT to interact with the proxy
async with Client(proxy_server) as client:
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    result = await client.call_tool("tool_name", {})
```

## The Correct Solution

### Understanding the Architecture

1. **FastMCP Proxy** acts as a transparent layer that forwards requests
2. **Client** is required to communicate with the proxy using MCP protocol
3. **HTTP endpoint** should create a client connection to the proxy for each request

### Proper Implementation Pattern

For an HTTP proxy server, we need to:

1. Create the proxy servers for each service
2. For each HTTP request, create a Client to communicate with the appropriate proxy
3. Use the Client to execute MCP operations
4. Return the results as JSON

```python
@app.post("/mcp/{service_name}")
async def proxy_mcp_request(service_name: str, request: Dict[str, Any]):
    proxy = service_manager.get_proxy(service_name)
    
    # Create a client to communicate with the proxy
    async with Client(proxy) as client:
        method = request.get("method")
        
        if method == "tools/list":
            tools = await client.list_tools()
            # Format and return tools
        elif method == "tools/call":
            result = await client.call_tool(name, arguments)
            # Format and return result
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Direct HTTP Transport

Instead of wrapping with FastAPI, run the proxy directly with HTTP transport:

```python
proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(ProxyClient(backend_server))
proxy.run(transport="http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

### Option 2: SSE Transport

Use Server-Sent Events for better streaming support:

```python
proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(ProxyClient(backend_server))
proxy.run(transport="sse", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

### Option 3: Custom Protocol Handler

Implement a custom handler that properly creates client connections:

```python
class MCPProtocolHandler:
    def __init__(self, proxy):
        self.proxy = proxy
    
    async def handle_request(self, mcp_request):
        async with Client(self.proxy) as client:
            # Route requests based on method
            return await self._route_request(client, mcp_request)
```

## Key Learnings

1. **FastMCP proxies are not meant to be accessed directly** - they require a Client
2. **The proxy pattern is designed for transport bridging** - not for direct method calls
3. **Each request should create a fresh client session** for proper isolation
4. **The examples directory is invaluable** for understanding correct patterns

## Next Steps

To fix our implementation, we need to:

1. Refactor the HTTP handler to create Client connections
2. Use the Client to execute MCP operations
3. Properly format the responses according to MCP protocol
4. Consider using FastMCP's built-in HTTP transport instead of custom FastAPI wrapper
