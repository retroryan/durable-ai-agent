# Agentic Loop Demo Configuration

# MCP Transport Configuration
# Controls HOW weather tools connect to MCP servers (only affects weather/agriculture tools)
# - true: Use stdio (direct process communication, no Docker needed)
# - false: Use HTTP (requires MCP servers running locally)
MCP_USE_STDIO=false

# HTTP Mode Configuration (when MCP_USE_STDIO=false)
# Use local servers (run with: poetry run python scripts/run_mcp_servers.py)
MCP_USE_PROXY=false

# Local MCP Server URLs (when MCP_USE_PROXY=false)
# Each tool connects to its respective server
MCP_FORECAST_URL=http://localhost:7778/mcp
MCP_HISTORICAL_URL=http://localhost:7779/mcp
MCP_AGRICULTURAL_URL=http://localhost:7780/mcp

# Mock Results Configuration  
# Controls WHAT DATA weather tools return (only affects weather/agriculture tools)
# - true: Return mock/simulated weather data for predictable testing
# - false: Make actual API calls to OpenMeteo weather services
TOOLS_MOCK=false

# Note: These two settings are independent:
# - You can use stdio transport with either mock or real data
# - You can use HTTP transport with either mock or real data
# - Other (non-weather) tools are not affected by these settings

# Logging Configuration
